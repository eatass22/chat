Big ass house where the tree lines hang 
Walls out of oak cigarette will never change 
Im still in the night red riva stay the same 
Ride like uncle buck with a buck oh mane
Never left the mountaineer bitch im back 
Cold coronas, iced tea, up on the rack 
Fights on at the bonfire you can get wakced 
Yz85 fuck it up on the tracks
Yea yea look up to the rear view
Dotted white lines turnin solid cant see thru… the snow 
Imm loooosssinnggg grip, 120 miles, backroads, on a trip 
Tryna change my ways but my face don’t fit 
Nevvvverrr left the home
Lewitch chain blind ya with the chrome
Wont be ever everrr known 
2k17 our homeeee 
Bucks froze up like the gnomes
